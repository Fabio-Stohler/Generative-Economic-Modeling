Example code for the analytical real-business-cycle model from "Generative Economic Modeling" by H. Kase, M. Rottner, and F. Stohler.


## How to ensure that Python code runs

When working on the code please follow the following instruction sets.

1. The code is tested with Python version 3.9.12. Make sure that you have a Python version installed which is compatible.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine. Open a shell and navigate to your preferred directory to save the project. Enter `git clone git@github.com:Fabio-Stohler/Generative-Economic-Modeling.git`. After cloning change the working directory in the shell to the base folder with `cd Generative-Economic-Modeling`.

3. To recreate the Python environment for running the example code the following steps are recommended to execute in a shell with the project root folder:

    a.) If not already installed, install virtualenv using `pip install virtualenv`.
    b.) Create a virtual environment (here called venv) in the project folder `virtualenv venv`.
    c.) Activate the virtual environment by running `venv\Scripts\activate`.
    d.) Install the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

4. To run
