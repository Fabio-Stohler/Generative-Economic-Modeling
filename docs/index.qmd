# Welcome

This site documents the Brock–Mirman (BM) surrogate example from the paper “Generative Economic Modeling”. Use the navbar to jump to the worked example or the cleanup plan.

## Quick start

1. Create a Python 3.11 virtualenv and install requirements:
   ```bash
   python3.11 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the BM analysis (loads pretrained surrogates by default):
   ```bash
   python src/analysis.py
   ```
3. Convert the example script to a notebook (optional):
   ```bash
   jupytext --to ipynb examples/analysis_BM.py
   ```
4. Render this site:
   ```bash
   quarto render docs
   ```

## Repository layout (summary)
